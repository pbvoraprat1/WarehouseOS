## 🎯 Why I Built This Project

This project was built to practice real-world backend development rather than simple CRUD operations.

The main goals were to learn

- REST API Design
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Transaction Management
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- React Query
- Full-stack Architecture

while following patterns commonly used in production applications.
